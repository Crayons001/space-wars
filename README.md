## About Space Wars
Space wars is a simple desktop game written entirely in Python. It makes use of Python's 'Turtle' library for graphics and the 'tkinter' module for user interaction. This version of space wars is not my original idea, but it was made to help learn and teach the fundamentals of game programming.

## Game Story
Space wars is an exciting dive into an imaginary intergalactic scene where you as the player are a great defender. As you pilot your powerful spacecraft across the galaxy, you get to shoot down enemies who threaten its safety while protecting your allies. The goal of this endless game is to defend the galaxy for as long as you can before your inevitable death. Watch out, however, as your deadly missiles do not discriminate between your enemies and your allies. And yes, friendly fire will not be tolerated. In this time-based game, how long can you last?

## Game mechanics
In this universe, the enemies are represented by red circles while the allies are represented by blue squares. There is a score counter at the top left of the screen and every round is timed. The goal is to last for as long as you can with the game's progressing difficulty. The spacecraft that you control is loaded with an infinite number of missiles. When you succesfully shoot down an enemy, the score increases by 100. If you shoot down an ally, your score decreases by 50 and if you collide with an enemy, you score also decreases by 100. The game ends when your score falls below zero, at which point, the total time that you have lasted on that round is displayed. How long you last is directly proportional to how good you are at the game.
